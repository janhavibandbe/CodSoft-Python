This repository contains three Python projects that I have developed as part of my internship at CodSoft. Each project showcases different aspects of Python programming, from GUI development to console-based applications. Below is a brief description of each project.

## Projects
## 1. Calculator (GUI-based)
    Description: A comprehensive calculator developed using Tkinter for the GUI and Numpy library for scientific calculations.

    Features:
    1. Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
    2. Scientific functions (square root, power, trigonometric functions, logarithms, etc.)

    Technologies: Python, Tkinter, Numpy

    How to Run:
    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

    Install required libraries:
    pip install numpy

    Run the calculator script:
    python calculator.py

## 2. Random Password Generator (GUI-based)
    Description: A user-friendly random password generator with a graphical interface that allows users to specify password length and character types.

    Features:
    1. Specify password length
    2. Include/exclude numbers and special characters

    Technologies: Python, Tkinter

    How to Run:
    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

    Install required libraries:
    pip install random

    Run the calculator script:
    python RPG.py

## 3. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (Console-based)
    Description: A console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows the user to play against the computer. The game tracks the win count for both the user and the computer and displays the winner at the end.

    Features:
    1. Play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer
    2. Tracks and displays win count for both user and computer
    3. Determines the overall winner at the end of the game

    Technologies: Python

    How to Run:
    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

    Install required libraries:
    pip install random

    Run the calculator script:
    python RPSGame.py
